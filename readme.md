WordPress Child Theme Template Readme

How to Use
Create a folder in /wp-content/themes/{your_theme_name}/
Copy both functions.php and style.css from this gist into that folder.
Replace all text in {braces} with appropriate values for your theme
There are replacements in both files! The theme likely won't work if you don't make all replacements and remove all braces
